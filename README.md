# LiveSplit WebSocket Server

LiveSplit WebSocket Server is a LiveSplit component that allows for other programs and other computers to read and control LiveSplit. 

## Setup 

Add the component to the Layout (Control -> LiveSplit WebSocket Server). In Layout Settings, you can change the Server Port and view your local IP Address and allowing to auto start.

### Control 

You can start the Server before programs can talk to it (Right click on LiveSplit -> Control -> Start Server). Unlike LiveSplit Server, this component has the ability to auto start.
